# Java Reactive Programming Learning Project

Hi, I'm **Md. Azmol Karim** üëã  

Welcome to this project!  
This repository is dedicated to exploring **Java Reactive Programming** in depth.  
The goal is to serve as a learning hub where we can practice and grow together as Java Reactive programmers.  

Along the way, I also integrate **Spring Boot** periodically to demonstrate real-world use cases and practical applications.  

Let‚Äôs dive in and learn Reactive Programming step by step üöÄ  

---

## üìö What You'll Learn
- Fundamentals of **Reactive Programming** in Java  
- Working with **Reactor** (Mono, Flux, Operators)  
- Applying backpressure and asynchronous data streams  
- Integrating **Reactive Streams with Spring Boot**  
- Building reactive REST APIs  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17+**  
- **Maven** or **Gradle**  
- **Spring Boot** (for integration examples)  
- An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse**  

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AzmolKarim313/reactive-programming-playground.git
cd reactive-programming-playground
```

## üß© Learning Sections
### Section 01: Core Reactive Components
- Create a custom Publisher, Subscriber, and Subscription
- Implement their core logic step by step

### Section 02: Exploring Mono
In this section, we dive into the major operations of the Mono publisher.
- Lecture 01: Non-Mono Lazy Operations
- Lecture 02: `Mono.just()`
- Lecture 03: `Mono.subscribe()`
- Lecture 04: `Mono.empty()` & `Mono.error()`
- Lecture 05: `Mono.fromSupplier()`
- Lecture 06: `Mono.fromCallable()`
- Lecture 07: `Mono.fromRunnable()`
- Lecture 08: `Mono.fromFuture()`
- Lecture 10: `Mono.defer()`
- Lecture 11: Non-blocking I/O

### üéØ Assignment - Mono Example

Create a FileService using Mono that can:
- Read a file
- Write to a file
- Delete a file

All operations must be implemented reactively using Mono.

### Section 03: Exploring Flux
In this section, we dive into the major operations of the Flux publisher.
- Lecture 01: `Flux.just()`
- Lecture 02: Multiple Subscribers
- Lecture 03: `Flux.fromIterable()` & `Flux.fromArray()`
- Lecture 04: `Flux.fromStream()`
- Lecture 05: `Flux.Range()`
- Lecture 06: Log Information using pipelines
- Lecture 07: Flux vs List execution and monitor performance
- Lecture 09: `Flux.interval()`
- Lecture 10: `Flux.empty()` & `Flux.error()`
- Lecture 11: `Flux.from()` [for Mono to Flux] & `Flux.next(), Mono.from()` [for Flux to Mono]

### üéØ Assignment - Flux Example

- The stock service will emit price changes every 500ms for ~20 seconds.
- The price might change between 80 - 120.
- Task:
  - Create subscriber with $1000 balance
  - Whenever the price drops below $90, you should buy the stock
  - When price will be above $110
    - You should sell the stock
    - Cancel your subscription
    - Print your profit

### Section 04: Flux - Emitting Items Programmatically
- Lecture 01: `Flux.create()`
- Lecture 02: Flux create refactor
- Lecture 03: Flux Thread Safe - here have both exercise **threadUnsafe [Traditional Programming]** and **threadSafe [using Flux]**.
- Lecture 04: `Flux.create()` downstream pipeline.
- Lecture 05: Learn `take()`, `takeWhile()`, `takeUntil()` operators
- Lecture 06: `Flux.generate()`
- Lecture 07: `Flux.generate()` but using state

### üéØ Assignment - Flux Programmatically Example

You have a fileReader interface, there have one method readFile(path)
- do the work when it is subscriber
- do the work based on the demand
- stop producing when subscription cancelled
- produced only requested item
- file should be closed when it is finished

### Section 05: Operation
- Lecture 01: `.handle()` - Handle behaves like filter + map.
- Lecture 02: Assignment of `.handle()`.
- Lecture 03: `.do*()` there have many callback function in this example.
- Lecture 04: `.delay()`
